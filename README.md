# Pool Pump Timer Instructions
A timer for my pool pump using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a custom-made PCB. This replaces the previous version which used a PIC12 with a clumsy button interface that was my first PCB.

These are the instructions for use for whoever lives in our house after us.

(Need to update instructions)
